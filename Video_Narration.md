What you're going to see is an app that helps to automatically track attendance for classes
It has both a student view and a teacher view

The first screen you see is the login screen, where you identify yourself and say which role you have.  Eventually this should be a full login page that ties into the school's authentication.

Lets start as a teacher.

You can see the list of classes here.  We are going to go ahead and edit a class.  You can see that the class has a bunch of options.

You input the class ID, name of the class and the class schedule.  You can have multiple times.  That is important later.
You can see there are also flags to set the requirements for attendance.
In this case, we're going to require a location and activity tracking - this will make sure the student is still and that they're in the right location during class time.

I'm going to set the location to where I'm at - just for demo purposes.

You can see we can also look at the enrollment report here, which tells us who is enrolled and who's been to class or not.

Let me also bring up a different class that is going to support checkin via QR code.

You can see the QR code button here, if you click on it the device generates a QR code for checkin.

Ok.  Now lets go back like a student

First, lets find a class and make sure we're enrolled.  
We'll search for that new QR code class we heard a lot about.

Here we can bring up the checkin screen (which we'll come back to in a bit), but we'll make sure we're enrolled.

Now we can see a report of our attendance in various classes  We're doing ok.

Now lets go into that first class we were looking at.  You can see that the system checks to make sure that we're in a valid class time, that we are in the right location for the class, and that the activity check works.  The activity check takes a bit (since we have to be still for a while).

Once all our prerequisites are all set, you can see that our checkin button goes green.  We can then check in.

Ok.  Last thing.

Remember that QR code?  Well I have it up on my laptop, so lets scan it with the regular Android camera.  That opens a URL that we have registered for that takes us right to the class check-in screen.

Now that screen can have any requirements that we want in it.  In this case we made it simple, so it just automatically checks in - if its during class time.
But we could have location or activity monitoring enabled, so that folks can't just share the QR code around.  If those are on, the screen will wait until it gets the results and then automatically check in - instead of making you click the button.

That's out demo.  Thanks for watching!
